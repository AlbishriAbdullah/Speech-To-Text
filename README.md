# Speech-To-Text
This repository for Second task in Web Development track.

Task Requerements:

1- Build a user interface to convert voice to text (speech to text)

2- Save the text output to database

---------------------------------------
To build Speech to Text recognition system, I prefer to use Python Programming Language with PocketSphinx and save the generated text to MySql database.

What is PocketSphinx ?

PocketSphinx is one of Carnegie Mellon University's open source large vocabulary, speaker-independent continuous speech recognition engines. t's designed to run on resource-constrained devices and can be used for offline speech recognition.

Limitation:

Accuracy: May not be as accurate as online services like Googleâ€™s speech recognition, especially for diverse and complex language patterns. So some words is not recognized well but we can say the result is acceptable.

--------------------------------------------
Install used libraries:

pip install mysql-connector-python

pip install pyaudio

 pip install SpeechRecognition
 
---------------------------------------------

Database query:

    CREATE DATABASE speech_text_db;

    USE speech_text_db;

    CREATE TABLE speech_text (

    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    
    text TEXT NOT NULL  );
